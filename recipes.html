                    <li>In a large pot, add the soaked beans and enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil and cook

                <ol>
                    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add the warm water and vegetable oil to the bowl while stirring continuously until a
                        dough forms.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 5 minutes until it
                        becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
                    <li>Shape the dough into a ball, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rest for about 30 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>While the dough is resting, prepare the filling of your choice. You can cook ground beef with
                        onions and spices, or mix cheese with herbs, or any other combination you prefer.</li>
                    <li>After the dough has rested, divide it into smaller portions and roll each portion into a thin
                        circle or rectangle (approximately 1/8 inch thick).</li>
                    <li>Place a spoonful of the filling onto one half of the rolled-out dough, leaving a small border
                        around the edges.</li>
                    <li>Fold the other half of the dough over the filling, pressing the edges together to seal it. You
                        can use a fork to crimp the edges for a decorative touch.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling.</li>
                    <li>In a deep pan or skillet, heat vegetable oil for frying. The oil should be deep enough to fully
                        submerge the pastels.</li>
                    <li>Carefully place the pastels into the hot oil, frying them in small batches to avoid overcrowding
                        the pan.</li>
                    <li>Fry the pastels until they turn golden brown and crispy, turning them over once to ensure even
                        cooking.</li>
                    <li>Once cooked, remove the pastels from the oil and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to
                        drain excess oil.</li>
                    <li>Serve the pastels hot and enjoy them with your favorite dipping sauce or salsa.</li>
