                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic,
                            and cook until the onion becomes translucent and fragrant.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add the shredded chicken to the pan and mix well with the onion and garlic.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pour in the chicken broth and season with salt. Cook for a few minutes until most of the
                            liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and set aside.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In a separate saucepan, combine the flour and milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring
                            constantly, until the mixture thickens and pulls away from the sides of the pan.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it for a few minutes until it
                            becomes smooth and elastic.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Take a small portion of the dough and flatten it in your hand. Place a spoonful of the
                            chicken filling in the center and shape the dough into a teardrop-shaped coxinha, enclosing
                            the filling completely. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Roll each coxinha in breadcrumbs until fully coated.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In a deep pan, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Fry the coxinhas in batches until they
                            turn golden brown, turning them occasionally to ensure even frying. Remove from the oil and
                            place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Serve the coxinhas hot and enjoy!
